## lazy loader
- create a lazy load tester which you can see if its worth lazy loading a function
-    that runs during runtime and displays live analytics
- time the function with and without lazy loading enabled
-    have it toggle after x resets
- come up with a way to hook into all functions, on a class or otherwise
-    capture the data in your local storage
-    display the data in a table
- and if you really want to go hard
-    display the data in a graph

## call tree
- visualize how frequently a function gets called to guage its importance
-    hook into all functions, on a class or otherwise
-    store data in local storage across multiple sessions
-    display the data as a tree structure akin to a WBS where the values are counts
